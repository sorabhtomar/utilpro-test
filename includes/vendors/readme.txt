VENDORS
This folder contains third-party code that I have not edited, so in theory you could update the code in this folder with any newer releases from the vendor and the theme should work fine.

Please note, however, that Utility Pro does reference these files, so if you replace them, be sure they are named as the original or update the references in Utility Pro.
